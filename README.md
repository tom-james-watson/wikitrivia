# disCO<sub>2</sub>very

A free software game to discover the orders of magnitude of the CO<sub>2</sub> footprint in our daily life and raise awareness about climate change.

*This application is based on the work done by Thomas James Watson (thank you! ❤️) for [wikitrivia](https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com). Original source code [on github](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/wikitrivia-scraper).*

## About

This project is using the open data provided by ADEME (*Agence de l'environnement et de la maîtrise de l'énergie*, the french State agency working on climate change). Raw data are avaible on ADEME website, with a [nice website for users](https://impactco2.fr), or through [an API](https://impactco2.fr/api-doc).

⚠️ As a consequence, the CO<sub>2</sub> data are based on France characteristics. The biggest difference with other countries is a very low carbon footprint for electricy consumption as France has mainly low carbon electrical plants. The CO<sub>2</sub> footprint for anything involving electricity would be very different in other countries like those using coal power plants for example.

## Contributions

Every contribution to the project is welcome! By contributing, you accept that your work is going to be placed under the AGPL licence (see the LICENSE file).

## Technical informations

This project is using the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) framework, itself based on ReactJS.
NodeJS 18.17.0 or higher is required to build and run the project.

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install
npm run i18n-compile
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/ to preview the website.

### Translations

disCO<sub>2</sub>very is using [Lingui](https://lingui.dev/) to manage translation. If you add or modify any sentences in the app, you have to run:

```bash
npm run i18n-extract
```
This will modify the english keys in `locales/en/messages.po`. Search for the ones starting with `#~`: they are now outdated and you should delete them.
Then go in the other languages files like `locales/fr/messages.po` and search for empty strings `""` to add the missing translation.

Once done, run:
```bash
npm run i18n-compile
```

### Static build

To build a static version of the website to the `out` folder, that you can then deploy anywhere (it's plain HTML + JS, no server needed) run:

```bash
npm run build
```
